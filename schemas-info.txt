**What are schemas?**
Schemas are JSON files that will help and aid you in creating your code and
will show you any errors that will come up when loading up your mod. A good example
is the Minecraft Bedrock Addon Schemas. If you have that schema installed in VSC it will help
you by suggesting things to be added into the code. It also provides useful tooltips when you hover over
the text to tell you what it does.
