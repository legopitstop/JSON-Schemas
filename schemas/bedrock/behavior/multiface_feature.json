During placement, existing world blocks are checked to see if this feature can be placed on them based on the list provided in the 'can_place_on' field. If no 'can_replace_on' field is specified, the 'place_block' block can be placed on any existing block. This feature will also try to spread the 'place_block' block around the location in world the feature is placed.\nSee https://bedrock.dev/docs/stable/Features#minecraft%3Amultiface_feature",
