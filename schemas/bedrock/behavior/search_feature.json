            "description": "'minecraft:search_feature' sweeps a volume searching for a valid placement location for its referenced feature. The 'search_volume' field specifies the axis-aligned bounding box that defines the boundaries of the search. The search sweeps along the axis defined by the 'search_axis' field, layer by layer. For example, if 'search_axis' = '-x', blocks with greater x values will be checked before blocks with lower x values. Each layer is searched from the bottom-left to the top-right before moving to the next layer along the axis. By default, only one valid position must be found, but this can be altered by specifying the 'required_successes' field. If fewer than the required successes are found, no placement will occur.Succeeds if: The number of valid positions is equal to the value specified by 'required_successes'.Fails if: The number of valid positions is less than the value specified by 'required_successes'.\nSee https://bedrock.dev/docs/stable/Features#minecraft%3Asearch_feature",
