The output position of the previous feature is used as the input position for the next. For example, a tree feature is placed at (0, 0, 0) and places blocks up to (0, 10, 0). The next feature in the sequence begins at (0, 10, 0).Succeeds if: All features in the sequence are successfully placed.Fails if: Any feature in the sequence fails to be placed. Features that have not yet been placed at the time of failure are skipped.\nSee https://bedrock.dev/docs/stable/Features#minecraft%3Asequence_feature",
