This uses more texture data than simply 'color' to enable richer, more realistic visuals. With the PBR approach, you can have layers for different specular reflections, emissivity, normal maps, etc. which goes beyond the Classic color pipeline for Vanilla Minecraft. Texture Sets have been added as the feature for defining multiple PBR layers for a texture resource. Texture sets are data driven from json files.",
